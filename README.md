Element

There are five elements in Valkyrie Crusade which are:

    Passion
    Cool
    Light
    Dark
    Focus

Elements characterize a card and offer a damage bonus against their opposite type (Passion↔Cool, Light↔Dark).

Every card is branded with its abbreviated rarity in the upper-left corner of the card.

    Normal Normal / High Normal High Normal
    Rare Rare / High Rare High Rare
